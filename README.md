# syscal_number.py

## Description

With this little script you can search for Linux system call names and get the system call number as a result. There are websites like https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/ or https://www.informatik.htw-dresden.de/~beck/ASM/syscall_list.html but who want's to google all the time whe he/she can have a command-line tool that works for 32bit **and** 64bit!
